# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
    1. I am getting a little better at using the technical terms to describe things, I usually know what in my head what to do, but do not know what things/actions are called so I can verbally describe what I am doing.
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
    1. Methods are reusable, so the same things dont have to be repeatedly done.
